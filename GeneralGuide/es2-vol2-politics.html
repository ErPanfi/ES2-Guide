        <p>Approval operates in two independent scopes. <strong>System Approval</strong> modifies Food and Influence output for that individual system. <strong>Empire Approval</strong> — a population-weighted average of all system approvals — modifies Dust and Science for your entire empire simultaneously. Industry is immune to Approval at every tier, in every scope.</p>

        <p>Approval is a <strong>discrete tier system</strong>, not a continuous gradient. Being at 31% and 69% is mechanically identical — both are Content, with zero modifier. The breakpoints that matter are 30, 70, and 85:</p>

      </div>
      <div class="block-body">
        <p>Every empire has a maximum number of systems it can support before incurring an overcolonization Approval penalty. When your system count exceeds this limit, each excess system applies a <strong>−10 Approval</strong> penalty empire-wide. This is a direct hit to Empire Approval, which means it immediately affects your Dust and Science multiplier.</p>

        <p>The overcolonization limit is not fixed — it can be raised through:</p>

        <ul class="step-list">
          <li><span class="step-n">TECH</span><span>Empire Development tree contains technologies that increase the overcolonization threshold. Researching these before pushing your colony count past the limit is the standard way to extend expansion room.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">LAWS</span><span>Certain Ecologist party laws provide additional system tolerance.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">GOVERNMENT TYPE</span><span>The Federation government type grants +1 system before triggering expansion disapproval.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS</span><span>Some improvements in the Empire Development tree add to the overcolonization threshold on a per-system basis.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additional Approval penalties that stack with overcolonization: <strong>razing systems</strong> applies −5 Approval per razed system permanently (a Republic government applies −15 per raze due to its law intensification). Mutinous populations after conquest also reduce system-level Approval temporarily.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warn">
          <div class="callout-label">THE COMPOUND FAILURE STATE</div>
          Overcolonization is dangerous not because the penalty is large per colony, but because it compounds with everything else. If you're at 72% Approval (Happy) and colonize one extra system dropping you to 62% (Content), you instantly lose +15% on all Dust and Science empire-wide. The new colony may take 10–20 turns to generate enough output to pay back that empire-wide loss. Expand just ahead of your limit, not into it.

      </div>
      <div class="block-body">
        <p>Overpopulation is a separate mechanic from overcolonization. A system becomes overpopulated when its population count exceeds the current capacity (determined by planet count and modernization level). Overpopulation applies a system-level Approval penalty, which cascades into Empire Approval.</p>

        <p>The Spaceport (unlocked at Level 2 modernization) is the primary relief valve: you can transfer surplus population from a full system to an underdeveloped one. This has two benefits simultaneously — it relieves the Approval penalty on the full system and accelerates development of the receiving system by providing labor immediately rather than waiting for it to grow organically.</p>

        <p>Population transfer is also a strategic optimization tool independent of overpopulation. A fully developed home system at max pops generates more FIDSI per pop by exporting surplus pops to new colonies than by sitting at overcapacity. The Spaceport essentially converts excess population growth on mature systems into colony-building acceleration on developing ones.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <div class="callout-label">APPROVAL RECOVERY TOOLKIT</div>
          When Approval drops below a critical tier, options in order of speed:<br><br>
          <strong>1. Enact a Happiness law</strong> — the Toys for Boys law (Scientist party) applies +25 Approval empire-wide. Caveat: it also costs −10% Industry on all systems. Only activate it when the Approval gain outweighs the Industry loss — typically from mid-game when your Industry base is large enough that 10% is trivial compared to +25% on Dust and Science.<br><br>
          <strong>2. Luxury resource improvements</strong> — assigning a happiness luxury resource (Jadonyx, Dust Trees, etc.) to system slots gives permanent per-pop Approval bonuses. These are permanent and don't carry the Industry penalty.<br><br>
          <strong>3. Population management</strong> — moving unhappy population types out of systems via Spaceport, or adding population types with high natural Approval, shifts the system-level average.<br><br>
          <strong>4. Sell an outpost</strong> — the planet broker allows selling underperforming outposts. This removes the overcolonization penalty immediately, refunds Dust, and may be the correct choice for systems that will never generate enough FIDSI to justify the Approval cost.

        <p>The Empire Development quadrant governs the infrastructure for population growth, Approval management, expansion capacity, and ship hull access. It is the tree most directly tied to how fast and how wide your empire can grow without degrading.</p>

        <p><strong>Stage 1 — Food and colony foundations:</strong> Early Stage 1 techs provide the basic colony ship hull and Food production improvements. The Sustainable Farms improvement (early Stage 1) is the core Food building for most factions, providing a flat Food bonus per system. Getting Food-producing improvements built in your main systems early accelerates population growth, which accelerates every other output.</p>

        <p><strong>Stage 2 — Approval and hull upgrades:</strong> This stage contains most of the basic Approval improvements and the first meaningful ship hull upgrade (Hunter-class hulls, which are significantly stronger than starter hulls). The Ecologist party's "Hardship Ready" colonization law tech appears here, allowing colonization of non-standard planet types without separate tech prerequisites (for factions that can access it).</p>

        <p><strong>Stage 3 — Overcolonization threshold and political development:</strong> Stage 3 is where the overcolonization limit extension technologies live. Xeno-Anthropology (the government change tech) also appears here — this is the tech that lets you switch government type mid-game, a significant strategic decision. Additional Food-to-population scaling improvements appear at this stage.</p>

        <p><strong>Stage 4 — Advanced hulls and political entrenchment:</strong> Carrier-class hulls (the largest standard hulls) unlock in Stage 4. Advanced Approval management improvements appear here, as well as the System Shield improvement (protection against Obliterator shots).</p>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <div class="callout-label">HULL TIER MATCHING</div>
          A critical principle from the community: ship hull size matters more for combat effectiveness than the tier of modules installed. Matching hull tier to module tier produces stronger ships than mixing. Stage 2 Military techs on Hunter hulls (Stage 3 Empire Development) outperform Stage 2 Military techs on starter hulls. Research hull upgrades in Empire Development alongside military module upgrades — don't let one outpace the other by too many stages.

        <p>To colonize a system, you need a Colony Ship equipped with a colonization module. When the ship reaches a system containing a habitable planet (a planet whose type you have the technology to colonize), you plant an outpost. The Colony Ship disappears on use — it is consumed. The system now shows as an outpost, not a full colony.</p>

        <p>Outposts require a Food supply to grow into full colonies. The Food supply comes from a connected system, not from the outpost itself. By default this is the nearest connected system, but you can manually reassign the supply source to a closer or more Food-productive system to accelerate growth. The growth timeline is visible in the outpost screen.</p>

        <p>Ways to accelerate outpost growth:</p>

        <ul class="step-list">
          <li><span class="step-n">MANUAL SUPPLY SOURCE</span><span>Assign the closest high-Food system as the supply source. Food traveling fewer hops arrives faster. A system 1 hop away supplies faster than one 3 hops away.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">SPEND INFLUENCE</span><span>Investing Influence increases the Food supply rate to the outpost for several turns, shaving turns off the growth timer.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">SPEND DUST</span><span>Same effect — Dust can also accelerate outpost development.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">CONTESTED OUTPOST</span><span>If two factions plant outposts in the same system simultaneously, they race for control. You can spend Manpower to raid the enemy outpost's Food supply, slowing their growth and accelerating yours. Conversely, blockading the system with a fleet prevents any Food supply ships from reaching an enemy outpost.</span></li>

      <div class="block-body">
        <p>When an outpost is growing, it draws approximately 40% of the Food production from its supply source system. This is significant: one active outpost consumes nearly half the Food surplus of its donor system. Two simultaneous outposts drawing from the same system can consume most of its Food output — potentially causing population shrinkage in the donor system if it was already running lean.</p>

        <p>Before planting a second outpost, check whether your primary Food-producing system can support two supply draws without going negative. If it cannot, either develop another high-Food system to act as the second supply source, or stagger your colonizations so the first outpost completes (becoming a self-sustaining colony) before the second Food draw begins.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <div class="callout-label">OUTPOSTS AS RESOURCE NODES</div>
          An outpost does not need to become a productive colony to pay for itself. Even an undeveloped outpost produces the strategic and luxury resources on its planets — these can be sold on the Marketplace immediately for Dust. A system with a good Titanium deposit starts generating Marketplace income the turn you plant the outpost, before a single pop has grown there. This framing — outpost as a mining probe rather than a future colony — changes how you evaluate colonization targets.

        <p>Every colonization triggers two costs: an Approval hit (overcolonization penalty if you're at or near your limit) and a Food draw from an existing system. Against these costs you're betting on the target system's future FIDSI output. The decision is a payback period calculation, not a binary "good system or bad system."</p>

        <p>Factors that make a system worth colonizing despite an Approval hit:</p>

        <ul class="step-list">
          <li><span class="step-n">PLANET COUNT</span><span>More planets means more population slots, which means more total FIDSI at full development. A 4–5 planet system pays back its Approval cost faster than a 1–2 planet system because its production ceiling is much higher.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">PLANET TYPES</span><span>Match planet types to your empire's current needs. If Industry is your bottleneck, a system with multiple Hot planets is immediately valuable. A system with all Cold planets is only valuable if Science is a priority and you have Cold-production improvements built.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">STRATEGIC RESOURCES</span><span>Systems with Titanium or Hyperium start generating Marketplace income as an outpost. Adamantium and above require curiosity detection to find and exploitation tech to use — don't colonize for a resource you can't yet exploit.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">LUXURY RESOURCES</span><span>A system with Tier 2 or Tier 3 luxury resources you currently lack is valuable immediately as a supply source. Check whether you already have sufficient quantities of that luxury before prioritizing colonization for it.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">STRATEGIC POSITION</span><span>Sometimes the right reason to colonize a mediocre system is to deny it to a rival or to establish a forward presence near a contested border. This is a valid reason — just be honest that you're paying an economic cost for a strategic benefit.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-warn">

          Small systems (1–2 planets) with no strategic resources and no luxury resources rarely pay back their Approval cost within a game's timeline. They produce modest FIDSI at full development and consume a colonization tech slot, a Colony Ship (Industry cost), and an overcolonization point. Skip these unless they serve a specific strategic purpose. You can always colonize them later after your expansion limit is higher.

        <p>The calculation is not complex once framed correctly. When considering a colonization that will drop your Empire Approval by one tier:</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify which Approval tier you're in now, and which tier you'd drop to. The difference in Dust + Science multiplier is the cost per turn (e.g., dropping from Ecstatic to Happy costs 15% on all Dust and Science).</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply that percentage to your current empire-wide Dust and Science output. If you produce 500 Dust/turn and 300 Science/turn, a 15% loss costs 75 Dust and 45 Science per turn — every turn until you recover the Approval tier.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Estimate how many turns the new colony will take to reach useful output (typically 10–20 turns for a basic outpost to start contributing meaningfully). Multiply the per-turn loss by those turns to get the total cost window.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Ask whether the new colony will eventually produce more than that cost, and within what timeframe. A 5-planet system with good types will — a 1-planet barren rock probably won't, ever.</p>

        <p>This framework applies to all factions. The specific numbers change depending on your current output scale and the tier you're crossing, but the logic is identical. Expansion is not unconditionally good — it is conditional on the payback period being acceptable.</p>

        <p>Influence has no default planet type — unlike Science (Cold planets), Industry (Hot planets), or Food (Fertile planets), Influence is not naturally produced by any planet tag. Every point of Influence must come from System Improvements, Hero bonuses, specific Population types, Unique Planets, or anomalies that specifically grant Influence output.</p>

        <p>The primary source for most empires is population: having population units assigned to planets in a system generates Influence for that system. The United Empire has a +1 Influence per pop affinity on top of this baseline, making them a notably Influence-heavy faction. Some minor faction assimilation bonuses also provide flat Influence per system.</p>

        <p>Influence is affected by System Approval (not Empire Approval). This means a system running low Approval produces less Influence — another reason to keep individual system approval high, beyond just the empire-wide multiplier chain.</p>

        <p>Influence produced by a system is automatically invested in expanding that system's colored border on the map — its <strong>Influence area</strong>. This is not stockpiled separately; it feeds the zone expansion each turn.</p>

        <p>The Influence zone radius formula is nonlinear:</p>

        <div class="influence-formula">
          Influence Radius = ((System Influence / Game Speed Multiplier) / π)^0.4 × (1.5 + (50 / System Influence))
        </div>

        <p>In practical terms: higher Influence production expands the zone faster, but returns diminish at very high values. A system producing very little Influence will have a tight border that barely covers adjacent space; a high-Influence system can extend its zone several systems away.</p>

        <p>What the Influence zone provides:</p>

        <ul class="step-list">
          <li><span class="step-n">VISION</span><span>The zone reveals all non-cloaked ships within its borders. This is passive intelligence — no probe or fleet needed to see what's moving inside your zone.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">COLONIZATION EXCLUSION</span><span>Uncolonized systems within your Influence area cannot be colonized by other factions without declaring war first.

          <li><span class="step-n">SPECIAL NODE BONUSES</span><span>Non-planetary special systems (asteroid fields, nebulae) inside your Influence area grant their passive bonuses to the system covering them.</span></li>
          <li><span class="step-n">PEACEFUL CONQUEST</span><span>If your Influence zone expands to envelop a foreign-owned system, you can potentially absorb it peacefully if you have researched the Pacific Conversion technology — without declaring war.</span></li>

          When two factions' Influence areas collide, a border forms between them. The side with higher Influence production pushes the border gradually backward — visible on the map as a faint pulsing toward the direction of growth. You can see borders being contested in real time. A high-Influence frontier system actively expands your territorial claims against neighbors; a low-Influence frontier system slowly loses ground to rivals without any military action.

          <li><span class="step-n">DIPLOMACY</span><span>Proposing agreements, requesting truces, and trading assets with major factions all cost Influence. When a weaker faction uses Influence to force a truce on you, you can spend Influence to refuse and continue the war.</span></li>

          <div class="callout-label">INFLUENCE IS THE HARDEST FIDSI TO PRODUCE</div>
          Influence is explicitly described as the hardest FIDSI to obtain in the game. No default planet type generates it, and most improvements that provide it are conditional on specific planet types or population compositions. Build Influence production actively and deliberately — don't assume it will accumulate on its own. Running low on Influence at a critical diplomatic moment (a forced truce you need to refuse, an election you need to control) is a common mid-game failure mode.

        <p>The Senate is populated by representatives from each system in your empire, allocated proportionally based on each system's population composition. The party with the most representatives leads, and the leading party's default law activates automatically at no cost. Additional laws can be passed up to the slot limit imposed by your government type (between 2 and 6 active laws depending on government).</p>

        <p>Elections occur every 10–20 turns depending on game speed. Between elections, parties accumulate <strong>political experience</strong> proportional to how long they've held Senate seats. This experience unlocks stronger laws: Level 1 laws are available from the start; Level 2–4 laws require the party to have been entrenched long enough. This creates a compounding advantage — a party that's been in power for 30 turns has access to significantly stronger laws than one that won the last election for the first time.</p>

        <p>Laws cost Influence to maintain. The higher the party's law level, the higher the upkeep cost per population unit in your empire. Monitor this carefully at high pop counts — sustaining Level 4 laws at 200+ population can consume a substantial fraction of your Influence income.</p>

        <p>The Religious party's Sanctioned Miracles law deserves special mention: it sets a floor on Approval regardless of overcolonization, razed systems, or mixed populations.

        <p>This creates a deliberate tension in hero recruitment: a Counselor hero might have valuable trade skills for governing, but if their political affiliation is a party you're actively trying to suppress, hiring them may shift Senate votes away from your preferred alignment. When recruiting heroes, review their party affiliation alongside their skill set.</p>

        <p>Example: a Pacifist hero assigned to a system with a large Pacifist population counts toward Pacifist Senate votes from that system.

        <p>Election interference is a short-term lever. Long-term political control is built through <strong>population composition</strong>. Every population type has a natural affinity for specific parties — Imperials boost Industrialists and Scientists; Vaulters strongly back Scientists; Horatio pops tend toward Pacifists. The populations you grow, assimilate, and breed determine your Senate baseline over the course of the game.</p>

        <p>Some population affinities also provide support to adjacent parties (parties closer on the political spectrum). This means that growing Militarists-aligned pops can also shift votes toward Scientists (their adjacent party), and Pacifists can gain votes from populations that primarily support Industrialists. Understanding these adjacencies lets you stack Senate compositions more deliberately.</p>

        <p>The strategic implication: your decisions about which minor factions to assimilate and which alien populations to breed are not just FIDSI decisions — they are simultaneously political decisions. An empire that carefully selects for Industrialist-affiliated minor faction pops will maintain Industrialist dominance election after election without spending Influence on interference, while an empire that assimilates randomly may find itself unable to sustain the laws it wants.</p>

        <p>This is one of the most underutilized strategic dimensions by intermediate players: treating political alignment as a colonization and population management criterion, not just as an outcome you react to.</p>

    scenario: "Turn 20. You have 4 colonized systems. Empire Approval is 87% (Ecstatic). You produce 420 Dust/turn and 310 Science/turn across your empire. A 5th system is available — 4 planets (2 Hot, 1 Fertile, 1 Cold), no strategic resources, no luxury resources. Colonizing it will push you past your overcolonization limit, dropping Empire Approval to 77% (Happy).",
    q: "What is the correct analysis of this colonization?",
    opts: [
      "Colonize immediately — 4 planets will eventually produce more than the penalty costs.",
      "Reject it — overcolonization always makes expansion net-negative until the limit is raised.",
      "Evaluate the payback period. Dropping from Ecstatic to Happy costs 15% on 420 Dust + 310 Science = −63 Dust/turn and −46.5 Science/turn. That's ~110 FIDSI/turn lost immediately, every turn until you recover Approval or the colony develops. The 4-planet system with no resources will take 15–25 turns to generate 110 FIDSI/turn. Before colonizing: can you raise the overcolonization limit first (through tech or law)? If not, is there a high-value system nearby instead? If this is the best available target, the payback is marginal but possible — accept with eyes open.",
      "Colonize, but immediately enact Toys for Boys to recover the Approval loss."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explain: "Option C is the correct framing. This is a payback period problem. Dropping from Ecstatic (85+, +30%) to Happy (70–84, +15%) costs exactly 15% on all Dust and Science empire-wide — not just in the new system but everywhere simultaneously. At the numbers given, this is roughly 110 FIDSI/turn lost from turn 1. A 4-planet system with no resources starts contributing near zero and takes many turns to ramp up. The honest answer is: the math is marginal, and whether to proceed depends on whether you have any better option or any way to avoid the tier drop (via tech). Option A ignores the timing of the cost. Option B is too absolute — overcolonization is sometimes worth it if the system is strong enough. Option D works in theory, but Toys for Boys also costs −10% Industry on all systems, which may replace one cost with another."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Turn 28. You are in a Republic government. The Pacifist party has been in your Senate for 20 turns and has reached Level 3. Their Sanctioned Miracles law would lock your Approval at Content (or Happy in a Republic) permanently regardless of how many systems you colonize. Your current Approval is 81% (Happy). You want to expand to 8 systems total over the next 20 turns.",
    q: "Should you pass Sanctioned Miracles?",
    opts: [
      "No — your current Happy tier already provides +15% on Dust/Science; Sanctioned Miracles only guarantees Content, which is worse.",
      "Yes — if you plan to colonize aggressively to 8 systems, the overcolonization penalties would likely drop you below Happy anyway. In a Republic, Sanctioned Miracles sets the floor at Happy (+15% on Dust/Science), not just Content. Locking in Happy permanently while expanding to 8 systems removes Approval management as a constraint and lets you colonize without calculating payback periods for each new system.",
      "No — the Influence upkeep cost of Sanctioned Miracles is too high at 8 systems.",
      "Yes, but only after you've reached 8 systems — activate it reactively when Approval drops."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "Option B is correct. The key detail is Republic government, which intensifies law effects by ×1.5. Sanctioned Miracles in a Republic sets the Approval floor at Happy (70+), not just Content (30+) as in other governments. If you plan to colonize 4 more systems, the cumulative overcolonization penalties without this law would almost certainly drop you below Happy — likely to Content or worse — costing the +15% Dust/Science multiplier empire-wide. Locking in Happy via this law is therefore a net gain compared to the alternative trajectory. Option A makes an error: it assumes current Happy (81%) is the relevant comparison, but the trajectory matters. Option C's concern is valid but secondary — if the Influence cost is sustainable, the law pays back in FIDSI multiplier preservation. Option D — reactive activation — means you've already absorbed several turns of penalty you could have avoided."

  {
    scenario: "Turn 15. Your frontier system (Tau Ceti) produces 35 Influence per turn. The nearest rival (Sophons) has a frontier system 2 hops away producing 80 Influence per turn. There is a valuable unclaimed 4-planet system between your territories.",
    q: "What does the Influence zone mechanic mean for this contested system?",
    opts: [
      "Influence zones don't affect colonization — whoever builds a colony ship first wins.",
      "The Sophons' frontier system produces more than twice your Influence output. Their zone is expanding faster than yours and will envelop the contested system before yours does unless you intervene. Once a system falls inside their Influence zone, you cannot colonize it without declaring war. Your options: invest in Influence improvements at Tau Ceti to compete for the border, send a colony ship now before the zone closes, or accept that this system is theirs and identify the next target.",
      "Build military ships at the contested system to hold it regardless of Influence.",
      "Influence zones only matter after colonization, not for empty systems."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "Option B is the correct mechanical understanding. The Influence zone actively locks out colonization by other factions. With 80 vs. 35 Influence output, the Sophons' border is expanding roughly 2× as fast as yours toward the contested space. If their zone reaches the target system first, you lose your right to colonize it without a war declaration — a potentially significant diplomatic and military cost. The decision tree is: how fast will their zone reach the target (calculable roughly from the distance and the Influence difference), versus how long it takes to build and send a colony ship. If a colony ship can arrive before their zone does, plant the outpost immediately. If not, either boost your Influence at Tau Ceti quickly or accept the loss and redirect. Option A is factually incorrect — Influence zones explicitly block colonization. Option C ignores that military presence doesn't override zone colonization mechanics. Option D is also incorrect — empty systems inside a zone cannot be colonized without war."

  {
    scenario: "Turn 35. You have been running Industrialists as your dominant party for 25 turns — they are at Level 4 (Potent). Your Pollution: Not Our Problem law gives +1000 Industry/turn across your 150 pops. An election is 3 turns away and the survey shows Scientists are likely to win it, which would end Industrialist dominance and reduce the party to Level 0.",
    q: "What is the most effective way to protect your Industrialist law access long-term?",
    opts: [
      "Spend Influence to reinforce the Industrialists this election — they just need to win one more time.",
      "Accept the election result and re-elect the Industrialists next election.",
      "Reinforce the Industrialists this election to maintain their Senate seat, but also review your system population composition. Long-term Industrialist dominance requires that Industrialist-affiliated populations outnumber Scientist-affiliated ones across your empire. If you've assimilated Vaulter-aligned pops or have a large Hekim (Sophon) population, they push votes toward Scientists every election. The election intervention is a short-term fix; population composition management is the structural solution.",
      "Switch to Republic government so law effects are intensified — this reduces the cost of losing party experience."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explain: "Option C is the complete answer. Election interference (Option A) wins the immediate election but doesn't address why Scientists are winning in the first place — your population composition is driving Scientists votes. If you fix the election but don't change who's in your systems, you'll face the same threat every 10–20 turns, spending Influence each time. The structural fix is identifying which systems are voting Scientist-heavy and either changing their population composition via Spaceport transfers, building Industrialist-aligned pops there, or assimilating Industrialist-aligned minor factions. Option B is passively accepting a long-term loss of your Level 4 law access — Industrialists reset to Level 0 if they lose the Senate, and rebuilding to Level 4 takes many more turns. Option D addresses a different problem — Republic helps intensify laws but doesn't preserve party experience or prevent the election outcome."
