        <div class="block-body">
          <p>Every fleet has a pool of <strong>Movement Points</strong> (MPs) consumed each time the fleet moves along a star lane to an adjacent system. MPs are a per-ship stat displayed on the ship design screen. <strong>Fleet speed is capped by its slowest ship</strong> — one low-MP vessel in your fleet degrades the entire formation. If you retrofit a scout ship with a stack of engines, that scout alone can give the whole fleet a meaningful speed boost via fleet accelerator support modules.</p>

          <p>The star lane network is the primary highway: two systems connected by a visible lane can be traversed in one movement action, provided the fleet has enough MPs. Once you have vision on a system — either by visiting it or by a probe passing through — that system remains visible permanently without a ship stationed there. Discovered systems also auto-reveal all star lanes emanating from them.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">FLEET SPEED BOTTLENECK</div>
            When building mixed fleets, always check the slowest ship's MP value. A single colony ship or support vessel dragging your strike force to 6 MPs instead of 10 costs you real turns on long-range operations. Either keep slow ships in separate fleets or use fleet accelerator support modules to compensate.
          </div>

          <p>The <strong>Auto-Explore</strong> fleet stance fans the fleet out and autonomously follows open star lanes, revealing adjacent systems each turn. Useful in the early game, but be aware the AI pathing will not prioritize high-value directions — manual guidance beats auto-explore once you've scouted enough to see where the good systems are.</p>

        <div class="block-body">
          <p>This is the rule that catches players out most often: <strong>if a fleet's movement order spans multiple turns, the final leg resolves at the end of the turn — not the beginning.</strong> This has a concrete tactical consequence.</p>

          <p>Suppose a fleet is four turns away from a destination system and you set a multi-turn waypoint, then hit End Turn. The fleet will arrive at the destination system and sit there — but only after everything else on that turn has already resolved. If you intended to arrive and then attack a pirate fleet in that system on the same turn, you cannot: the attack opportunity has already passed for that turn. The pirates may also have moved by the following turn.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-warn">
            <div class="callout-label">ALWAYS MOVE MANUALLY FOR SAME-TURN ACTIONS</div>
            Whenever you need to arrive at a system <em>and</em> take an action there on the same turn — attack, establish a blockade, collect a curiosity — move the fleet manually before ending your turn. Multi-turn queued movement will cost you an entire action window on arrival.
          </div>

          <p>The <strong>Sleep</strong> fleet stance parks the fleet in orbit and wakes it automatically when a probe or enemy enters the system. Useful for stationing a patrol ship at a minor faction's system to intercept pirate spawns without consuming your attention each turn.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Guard</strong> stance is distinct from Sleep: a guarding fleet actively intercepts any enemy ship entering the system, forcing it into orbit and halting its remaining MPs. While a fleet is guarding an enemy system, it also begins suppressing that system's resource output — luxury and strategic resources stop flowing to the defender. This is the blockade mechanic.</p>

          <p><strong>Wormholes</strong> are bidirectional connections between two systems that are not linked by a standard star lane. They appear on the galaxy map as a distinct connector type and function identically to star lanes for movement cost. Discovering a wormhole can dramatically cut travel time between distant galaxy sectors — finding one early that your opponent hasn't scouted yet is a genuine strategic edge.</p>

          <p><strong>Warp travel</strong> (unlocked via the <em>Compact Warp Methods</em> technology in the Science & Exploration tree) allows fleets to access systems that are not connected to the star lane network at all — including moons. Without this technology, those systems are visible but completely inaccessible. Moons can contain curiosities, anomalies, and resources, so the tech has real value beyond just range extension.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Ultra IR Astronomy</strong> technology (also in the Science tree) allows probes to discover special nodes and unconnected systems that wouldn't be found by standard star lane exploration. These nodes — black holes, asteroid fields, nebulae — are the locations where Science Behemoths park for passive bonuses. Without Ultra IR Astronomy, those nodes simply don't appear on your map.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">COLONY SHIP TIMING</div>
            A common early mistake is immediately dispatching the colony ship toward an unexplored system. Hold it. With two probes, you have a one-in-three chance of the best available system being in the wrong direction. Spending 1–2 turns scouting adjacent lanes before committing the colony ship costs less total turns than moving it the wrong way and backtracking.

          <p>The Science tree also contains science output buildings — most notably <strong>Public–Private Partnerships</strong>, which mirrors Xeno-Industrial Infrastructure from the Economy tree but for science instead of industry. On a high-adjacency planet, this building can near-double your science production from a single system. On a Terran Fertile planet, for instance, it provides the same kind of step-change that Xeno-Industrial does for industry.</p>

          <p>Science has a <strong>storage cap of two turns' worth of production</strong>. If you're producing 44 science per turn, you can bank up to 88 before the overflow is wasted. This means it's safe to leave the research queue empty for one turn without losing output — but not two. Plan your queue so you're picking the next tech before overflow kicks in, not after.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">QUEUE ONE TECH AT A TIME</div>
            Any science overflow from completing a tech automatically rolls into the next queued tech. If you leave the queue empty, overflow science is banked up to the two-turn cap. Queuing multiple techs in advance doesn't lose you anything, but the habit of queuing one and then checking what's next ensures you make deliberate choices rather than defaulting to whatever was pre-selected.

        <div class="block-body">
          <p>Probes are launched from ships that carry a probe module. The starting exploration ship comes with two probes. Probes can be added to hero ships as well, which is one of the best reasons to assign your starting hero to the scout fleet early — the hero ship's larger vision range and additional probe slots multiply your early coverage dramatically.</p>

          <p>Each probe has three key stats:</p>
          <ul class="step-list">
            <li><span class="step-n">LIFETIME</span><span>How many turns the probe remains active and moving. A lifetime of 5 means the probe travels for 5 turns before expiring.</span></li>
            <li><span class="step-n">RANGE</span><span>The vision radius of the probe at each position it passes through. A range of 4 reveals a 4-tile radius around its current location each turn.</span></li>
            <li><span class="step-n">SPEED</span><span>How many tiles the probe travels per turn. A speed of 6 means it covers 6 tiles of distance per turn of lifetime.</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Probes have a <strong>cooldown before they regenerate</strong>. The cooldown depends on the probe module type — standard probes have a longer cooldown, while Hyperium probes regenerate faster. Managing your probe timing matters in the early game: launching all probes at once leaves you without coverage for the cooldown window. Staggering launches is often better than firing everything simultaneously.</p>

          <p>The second use of probes is to launch an <strong>expedition</strong> at a curiosity site. This is distinct from throwing a probe into open space. When you click the expedition icon next to a curiosity on a planet, the probe is consumed (starting a cooldown) and after some turns returns results: anomaly discoveries, resource deposits, loot, or quest triggers.</p>

          <p>There is an alternative: <strong>investigating a curiosity via the system's build queue costs 100 Industry</strong>. At game start that is several turns of production. Using probes is free except for the cooldown. Always prefer probe expeditions over the build-queue method unless your probes are all on cooldown and the resource you might find would pay back the industry cost quickly (e.g., a luxury or strategic deposit in a system you're about to colonize).</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">HERO XP FROM PROBE DISCOVERIES</div>
            Heroes gain experience for each curiosity discovered — including those found by probes launched from a scout ship in the same fleet. This is why keeping the hero assigned to the exploration fleet, not stationed as a governor, is the correct early-game move. Every probe expedition nets hero XP at zero additional cost.
          </div>

          <p>Some curiosities can trigger the discovery of <strong>exile population ships</strong>. These small civilian vessels automatically move toward your nearest system and, if they arrive safely, add a population unit. Exiles can include rare faction pops. There is no way to redirect their path once spawned — if pirates are between them and your system, you may lose the pop.</p>

          <p>There is also at least one Unfallen-faction-specific curiosity type. All curiosity rewards have a probability distribution — the UI tooltip on hover shows the categories of outcomes (e.g., "high chance of anomaly / low chance of luxury resource") without guaranteeing specifics.</p>

            <div class="callout-label">DON'T RUSH HOME SYSTEM CURIOSITIES</div>
            Researching a curiosity on your starting system early carries a meaningful risk of triggering a negative anomaly before you have the tech to remove it. A detrimental anomaly applying a FIDSI nerf from turn 3 onward can compound into a significant economic setback. Leave home-system curiosities until you have OCP Investigation or Autonomous Materials researched, unless the reward probability is clearly favorable.

          <p>The science behemoth's core value proposition comes in two layers:</p>

          <p><strong>Layer 1 — System orbit bonus:</strong> A behemoth orbiting any system (yours or otherwise) provides a flat <strong>+10 to all FIDSI categories</strong> (Food, Industry, Dust, Science — not Influence) on that system. This is a passive bonus requiring no further action. The AI regularly exploits this by parking behemoths over their developed systems as both a boost and a defense anchor.</p>

          <p><strong>Layer 2 — Tech cost reduction:</strong> With the appropriate behemoth module researched, the science behemoth grants a <strong>−15% cost reduction on a specific tech tree branch</strong>. A second behemoth doubles this to approximately −30%. Community experience with science victories confirms this stacking is one of the primary acceleration mechanisms — the initial investment in multiple behemoth tech researches pays back rapidly through compressed tech timelines.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">SCIENCE VICTORY CORE LOOP</div>
            For science-victory-focused play: unlock behemoths, build one science behemoth (orbit your science-focused home system for +10 Science), research the tech cost reduction module, build a second science behemoth. The compound effect — more science production plus reduced tech cost — is the primary reason science victories can be competitive in speed against military paths.
          </div>

          <p>Behemoths cannot be embedded in a regular fleet — they move and fight alone. This means a military behemoth replacing your strike fleet is almost always a weaker choice than building one alongside a conventional fleet. A military behemoth's module count per slot is multiplied by ×4 (same as all large ships), but the isolation penalty usually outweighs raw firepower for most combat situations.</p>

          <p>Beneficial anomalies require no action — they are automatically active on the planet. There is no known tech that removes them (nor would you want one).

          <p>If the Pirates option is enabled at game setup, <strong>pirates spawn exclusively from minor faction systems</strong>. There is no other spawn source. This has a direct strategic implication: finding and controlling a minor faction's system controls the pirate spawning point for that galaxy node.</p>

          <p>Pirates can travel between galaxy nodes — a pirate spawned from a minor faction in a distant arm can eventually reach your systems. However, they originate from the minor faction's specific location, which means keeping a ship at that system gives you persistent interception capability.</p>

          <p>On <strong>Endless difficulty</strong>, pirate fleets field modernized ship designs — often better-equipped than early-game major faction ships. Treating them as a minor nuisance on higher difficulties is a mistake. A pirate fleet that catches your colony ship or lightly armed scout can end a colonization attempt outright.</p>

          <p>Because pirates respawn from minor faction systems on a predictable cycle, a fleet stationed at the spawning system fights them as they appear. This converts the pirate threat into a controlled hero and fleet XP source. The pattern is straightforward:</p>

          <p>Even before assimilation, a minor faction with a filled or partially filled relation bar generates <strong>passive tribute</strong> each turn — Manpower, Dust, Science, and/or Food depending on the minor faction's type. In the early game when your FIDSI numbers are small, a single well-developed minor faction relationship can contribute more Science per turn than your entire civilization's output.

Assimilation converts the minor faction's system into one of your own: the population stays, you gain full control of the system and can build there freely. The minor faction's population type brings its own FIDSI traits and political party affiliation into your empire — who you assimilate shapes your population composition over time.</p>

          <p>Not assimilating is also a valid choice. <strong>Maintaining a minor faction as a tribute source without absorbing them</strong> keeps your Overcolonization count lower (which matters for Approval), gives you continued passive FIDSI from the relationship, and avoids absorbing a population that might destabilize your political balance. The decision to assimilate should weigh the system's FIDSI value against the Approval cost of adding another colony.</p>

          <p>If you don't assimilate, the minor faction's population will still naturally <strong>migrate into your systems</strong> over time as you develop your empire and their pops find your systems more attractive. You gain the population benefits without the assimilation overhead.</p>

            This topic requires dedicated sourcing before it can be written to accuracy standard. What is confirmed from available session sources: the science victory requires building a specific ship (the "Endless" vessel), which in turn requires building a factory and researching the victory condition technologies; it also requires eliminating at least half the empires in the galaxy. The Endless Research Park and the Intergalactic Technology Center are once-per-galaxy unique buildings that are significant accelerators, and science victories on Endless difficulty are benchmarked around turn 50 in medium galaxies with fast speed. The detailed step-by-step requirements, commitment window, era gates, and the military self-defense interaction (cross-reference Vol.4 T10) are not adequately sourced and have been omitted.
          </div>
          <p>To complete this topic, please provide a wiki page or transcript that covers the full science victory checklist — specifically the exact building and research prerequisites for the final victory ship, whether era gates apply, and the relationship between tech completion and the victory timer.</p>

    scenario: "Turn 4. Your starting system has two curiosities on its home planet. You have three probes available and your research queue shows Baryonic Shielding (6 turns) and Machine Bacteria (5 turns) as ring-1 options. Your colony ship is idle in orbit. Your nearest unexplored star lane leads to a 2-planet system. Two other lanes are unexplored.",
    q: "What is the single biggest mistake you could make this turn?",
    opts: [
      "Launching all three probes down the single most promising star lane instead of spreading them",
      "Investigating both home-system curiosities now before moving anything",
      "Sending the colony ship immediately toward the nearest unexplored system",
      "Queuing Baryonic Shielding before Machine Bacteria"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explain: "Sending the colony ship immediately is the critical mistake. With three unexplored lanes, you have a one-in-three chance the best system is in the opposite direction. Holding the colony ship for one more turn (while probes map the adjacent systems) costs at most one turn in transit but prevents the costly mistake of committing to the wrong direction. Splitting probes (A) is suboptimal but recoverable. Investigating home curiosities (B) risks a detrimental anomaly early but is arguable. Baryonic before Machine Bacteria (D) is a valid priority debate, not a clear mistake."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Turn 12. You've colonized two systems. Your home system has a 'Strong Magnetic Field' anomaly on its second planet, currently causing a −4 Industry / −2 Science penalty per turn. You have 220 Science available and two tech options in the Science tree ring 2: OCP Investigation Unit (180 Science) and Autonomous Materials (200 Science). Your third planet in the home system has a mixed anomaly giving +3 Food / −2 Dust.",
    q: "Which technology should you research first, and why?",
    opts: [
      "Autonomous Materials — it addresses two anomalies at once (strips the negative from the mixed anomaly and partially helps with the magnetic field)",
      "OCP Investigation Unit — it fully eliminates the detrimental anomaly penalty, which is the more damaging of the two effects",
      "Neither — anomaly removal should wait until you have OCP and Autonomous Materials queued together to apply both fixes simultaneously",
      "OCP Investigation Unit, but only after finishing the current ring-1 queue to avoid losing science overflow"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "OCP Investigation directly nullifies detrimental anomaly effects — the Strong Magnetic Field on your production planet is a compounding FIDSI loss that has been active for 12 turns and will continue until removed. At −6 combined loss per turn, 12 turns has already cost you 72 FIDSI points. Autonomous Materials (A) only addresses mixed anomalies, not purely detrimental ones — it would help the Food/Dust mixed anomaly on the third planet but would not touch the Magnetic Field. Option C loses additional turns of unnecessary penalty. Option D is irrelevant — science overflow handling doesn't require holding off on research that addresses an ongoing FIDSI drain."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Turn 18. You have one minor faction at 60 relation — they provide +12 Science per turn as passive tribute. You have 400 Influence saved. Assimilating them would require reaching 100 relation (40 more points via Praise at ~30 Influence per increment, scaling up). Their system has two Arid planets with decent population slots and no anomalies. Assimilating would add 1 colony to your empire, currently at 3 colonized systems with Approval at 72%.",
    q: "Should you assimilate immediately, and what is the most important factor in that decision?",
    opts: [
      "Yes — the +12 Science/turn stops once you assimilate and direct ownership of their system is always superior",
      "No — the Approval cost of a 4th colony at 72% base Approval is the primary concern; the FIDSI value of their planets must be weighed against the multiplier loss",
      "Yes — 400 Influence is enough to max the relation bar immediately, so opportunity cost is low",
      "No — minor faction populations have lower base FIDSI than major faction pops and never justify the influence spend"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "The Approval multiplier is the core issue (covered in Vol.2 T1). Adding a 4th colony reduces Approval. If Approval drops below a threshold (e.g., from 72% into the 60s), the empire-wide FIDSI multiplier decreases, meaning all existing population becomes less productive. The +12 Science passive tribute continues as long as you don't assimilate — you don't lose it by waiting. Option A is incorrect: tribute income is not cancelled by high relations, only by assimilation or war. Option C ignores the Approval cost entirely. Option D is false — minor faction pops vary widely and some are excellent FIDSI contributors."

  {
    scenario: "Turn 22. You're playing a science-focused empire. The behemoth unlock quest just completed galaxy-wide. You have 380 Industry and can build a science behemoth in 4 turns. Your home system produces 48 Science/turn and you have 2 other colonized systems. You have not yet researched the behemoth tech-cost-reduction module.",
    q: "What is the correct sequence of actions to maximize science behemoth value?",
    opts: [
      "Build the science behemoth immediately and park it at your home system for the passive +10 Science bonus while you research the tech-cost-reduction module in parallel",
      "Research the tech-cost-reduction module first, then build the behemoth — building before researching the module means the behemoth provides only the flat +10 bonus until research completes",
      "Build two science behemoths simultaneously before researching any module, as the stacked orbit bonuses (+20 Science) exceed the single-behemoth +10 plus the tech reduction on most turn horizons",
      "Wait until you have both the tech-cost-reduction module and the second behemoth tech unlocked before building any — the combined effect is strictly better than partial implementation"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explain: "Option A is correct because the +10 FIDSI system orbit bonus is active the moment the behemoth is in orbit — you don't need the tech-cost-reduction module researched to benefit from it. Starting the build immediately and researching the module in parallel means you lose no turns of the orbit bonus. Option B delays the orbit bonus with no benefit. Option C cannot be done simultaneously — behemoth count is limited by your researched technologies, and you cannot build a second science behemoth without the appropriate upgrade tech. Option D wastes multiple turns of +10 Science bonus while waiting for ideal conditions."
