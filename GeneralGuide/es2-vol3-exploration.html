          <p>Every fleet has a pool of <strong>Movement Points</strong> (MPs) consumed each time the fleet moves along a star lane to an adjacent system. MPs are a per-ship stat displayed on the ship design screen. <strong>Fleet speed is capped by its slowest ship</strong> — one low-MP vessel in your fleet degrades the entire formation. If you retrofit a scout ship with a stack of engines, that scout alone can give the whole fleet a meaningful speed boost via fleet accelerator support modules.</p>

          <p>The star lane network is the primary highway: two systems connected by a visible lane can be traversed in one movement action, provided the fleet has enough MPs. Once you have vision on a system — either by visiting it or by a probe passing through — that system remains visible permanently without a ship stationed there. Discovered systems also auto-reveal all star lanes emanating from them.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">FLEET SPEED BOTTLENECK</div>
            When building mixed fleets, always check the slowest ship's MP value. A single colony ship or support vessel dragging your strike force to 6 MPs instead of 10 costs you real turns on long-range operations. Either keep slow ships in separate fleets or use fleet accelerator support modules to compensate.
          </div>

          <p>The <strong>Auto-Explore</strong> fleet stance fans the fleet out and autonomously follows open star lanes, revealing adjacent systems each turn. Useful in the early game, but be aware the AI pathing will not prioritize high-value directions — manual guidance beats auto-explore once you've scouted enough to see where the good systems are.</p>

        <div class="block-body">
          <p>This is the rule that catches players out most often: <strong>if a fleet's movement order spans multiple turns, the final leg resolves at the end of the turn — not the beginning.</strong> This has a concrete tactical consequence.</p>

          <p>Suppose a fleet is four turns away from a destination system and you set a multi-turn waypoint, then hit End Turn. The fleet will arrive at the destination system and sit there — but only after everything else on that turn has already resolved. If you intended to arrive and then attack a pirate fleet in that system on the same turn, you cannot: the attack opportunity has already passed for that turn. The pirates may also have moved by the following turn.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-warn">
            <div class="callout-label">ALWAYS MOVE MANUALLY FOR SAME-TURN ACTIONS</div>
            Whenever you need to arrive at a system <em>and</em> take an action there on the same turn — attack, establish a blockade, collect a curiosity — move the fleet manually before ending your turn. Multi-turn queued movement will cost you an entire action window on arrival.
          </div>

          <p>The <strong>Sleep</strong> fleet stance parks the fleet in orbit and wakes it automatically when a probe or enemy enters the system. Useful for stationing a patrol ship at a minor faction's system to intercept pirate spawns without consuming your attention each turn.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Guard</strong> stance is distinct from Sleep: a guarding fleet actively intercepts any enemy ship entering the system, forcing it into orbit and halting its remaining MPs. While a fleet is guarding an enemy system, it also begins suppressing that system's resource output — luxury and strategic resources stop flowing to the defender. This is the blockade mechanic.</p>

          <p><strong>Wormholes</strong> are bidirectional connections between two systems not linked by a standard star lane. They function identically to star lanes for movement cost. Finding one early that opponents haven't scouted is a genuine strategic edge — they can cut travel time between distant sectors dramatically. Note that wormhole <em>detection</em> is not automatic: the <strong>Autonomous Materials</strong> technology (Science T3) unlocks the <em>Hawking Radiation Dowser</em>, which is what enables your ships to detect wormholes. Without it, wormholes in unexplored regions of the map may not appear.</p>

          <p><strong>Free movement</strong> — travel to systems not connected to the star lane network — is unlocked by <strong>Baryonic Shielding</strong> (Science T2), which grants the <em>Warp Drive (Free Movement)</em> module. This is what allows access to unconnected systems and special nodes.</p>

          <p><strong>Compact Warp Methods</strong> (Science T3) is a distinct and separate technology. It does not grant the core warp capability — that is Baryonic Shielding's role. Compact Warp Methods instead unlocks <em>Moonbase Alpha</em> (a system improvement) and <em>Eco Habitats</em>, plus a Moon Exploration planetary improvement. In practice, it is the tech that makes moon colonization meaningful infrastructure rather than just accessible.</p>

          <p>Further movement upgrades continue through the tree: Science T4 adds a warp boost via <em>N-Dimensional Topologies</em> (Deep Space Fuel Scoop) and an <em>Accelerated Warp Drive</em> module. Science T5 unlocks the Anti-Matter Engine and <em>Hyperlight Acceleration</em>.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Low Kelvin Sciences</strong> technology (Science T4) unlocks <em>Ultra-MRI Astronomy</em>, which gives system vision of special nodes — the asteroid fields, black holes, and nebulae that science behemoths exploit. Without it, those nodes don't appear on your map at all.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">COLONY SHIP TIMING</div>
            A common early mistake is immediately dispatching the colony ship toward an unexplored system. Hold it. With two probes, you have a one-in-three chance of the best available system being in the wrong direction. Spending 1–2 turns scouting adjacent lanes before committing the colony ship costs less total turns than moving it the wrong way and backtracking.

          <p>The Science tree also contains science output buildings — most notably <strong>Public–Private Partnerships</strong>, which mirrors Xeno-Industrial Infrastructure from the Economy tree but for science instead of industry. On a high-adjacency planet, this building can near-double your science production from a single system. On a Terran Fertile planet, for instance, it provides the same kind of step-change that Xeno-Industrial does for industry.</p>

          <p>Science has a <strong>storage cap of two turns' worth of production</strong>. If you're producing 44 science per turn, you can bank up to 88 before the overflow is wasted. This means it's safe to leave the research queue empty for one turn without losing output — but not two. Plan your queue so you're picking the next tech before overflow kicks in, not after.</p>

            <div class="callout-label">QUEUE ONE TECH AT A TIME</div>
            Any science overflow from completing a tech automatically rolls into the next queued tech. If you leave the queue empty, overflow science is banked up to the two-turn cap. Queuing multiple techs in advance doesn't lose you anything, but the habit of queuing one and then checking what's next ensures you make deliberate choices rather than defaulting to whatever was pre-selected.

        <div class="block-body">
          <p>Probes are launched from ships that carry a probe module. The starting exploration ship comes with two probes. Probes can be added to hero ships as well, which is one of the best reasons to assign your starting hero to the scout fleet early — the hero ship's larger vision range and additional probe slots multiply your early coverage dramatically.</p>

          <p>Each probe has three key stats:</p>
          <ul class="step-list">
            <li><span class="step-n">LIFETIME</span><span>How many turns the probe remains active and moving. A lifetime of 5 means the probe travels for 5 turns before expiring.</span></li>
            <li><span class="step-n">RANGE</span><span>The vision radius of the probe at each position it passes through. A range of 4 reveals a 4-tile radius around its current location each turn.</span></li>
            <li><span class="step-n">SPEED</span><span>How many tiles the probe travels per turn. A speed of 6 means it covers 6 tiles of distance per turn of lifetime.</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Probes have a <strong>cooldown before they regenerate</strong>. The cooldown depends on the probe module type — standard probes have a longer cooldown, while Hyperium probes regenerate faster. Managing your probe timing matters in the early game: launching all probes at once leaves you without coverage for the cooldown window. Staggering launches is often better than firing everything simultaneously.</p>

          <p>The second use of probes is to launch an <strong>expedition</strong> at a curiosity site. This is distinct from throwing a probe into open space. When you click the expedition icon next to a curiosity on a planet, the probe is consumed (starting a cooldown) and after some turns returns results: anomaly discoveries, resource deposits, loot, or quest triggers.</p>

          <p>There is an alternative: <strong>investigating a curiosity via the system's build queue costs 100 Industry</strong>. At game start that is several turns of production. Using probes is free except for the cooldown. Always prefer probe expeditions over the build-queue method unless your probes are all on cooldown and the resource you might find would pay back the industry cost quickly (e.g., a luxury or strategic deposit in a system you're about to colonize).</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">HERO XP FROM PROBE DISCOVERIES</div>
            Heroes gain experience for each curiosity discovered — including those found by probes launched from a scout ship in the same fleet. This is why keeping the hero assigned to the exploration fleet, not stationed as a governor, is the correct early-game move. Every probe expedition nets hero XP at zero additional cost.
          </div>

          <p>Some curiosities can trigger the discovery of <strong>exile population ships</strong>. These small civilian vessels automatically move toward your nearest system and, if they arrive safely, add a population unit. Exiles can include rare faction pops. There is no way to redirect their path once spawned — if pirates are between them and your system, you may lose the pop.</p>

          <p>There is also at least one Unfallen-faction-specific curiosity type. All curiosity rewards have a probability distribution — the UI tooltip on hover shows the categories of outcomes (e.g., "high chance of anomaly / low chance of luxury resource") without guaranteeing specifics.</p>

            <div class="callout-label">DON'T RUSH HOME SYSTEM CURIOSITIES</div>
            Researching a curiosity on your starting system early carries a meaningful risk of triggering a negative anomaly before you have the tech to remove it. A detrimental anomaly applying a FIDSI nerf from turn 3 onward can compound into a significant economic setback. Leave home-system curiosities until you have OCP Investigation or Autonomous Materials researched, unless the reward probability is clearly favorable.

          <p>Special nodes are galaxy-map locations that exist outside the colonizable system network. They include <strong>asteroid fields, black holes, and nebulae</strong>. These nodes are not connected to the standard star lane grid and are therefore invisible without the <strong>Ultra IR Astronomy</strong> technology (Science tree), which enables probes to detect them.</p>

          <p>On their own, special nodes don't do anything for your empire. Their value comes from parking a Behemoth — specifically one configured with special-node extraction modules — in orbit.

          <p>The science behemoth's core value proposition comes in two layers:</p>

          <p><strong>Layer 1 — System orbit bonus:</strong> A behemoth orbiting any system (yours or otherwise) provides a flat <strong>+10 to all FIDSI categories</strong> (Food, Industry, Dust, Science — not Influence) on that system. This is a passive bonus requiring no further action. The AI regularly exploits this by parking behemoths over their developed systems as both a boost and a defense anchor.</p>

          <p><strong>Layer 2 — Tech cost reduction:</strong> With the appropriate behemoth module researched, the science behemoth grants a <strong>−15% cost reduction on a specific tech tree branch</strong>. A second behemoth doubles this to approximately −30%. Community experience with science victories confirms this stacking is one of the primary acceleration mechanisms — the initial investment in multiple behemoth tech researches pays back rapidly through compressed tech timelines.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">SCIENCE VICTORY CORE LOOP</div>
            For science-victory-focused play: unlock behemoths, build one science behemoth (orbit your science-focused home system for +10 Science), research the tech cost reduction module, build a second science behemoth. The compound effect — more science production plus reduced tech cost — is the primary reason science victories can be competitive in speed against military paths.
          </div>

          <p>Behemoths cannot be embedded in a regular fleet — they move and fight alone. This means a military behemoth replacing your strike fleet is almost always a weaker choice than building one alongside a conventional fleet. A military behemoth's module count per slot is multiplied by ×4 (same as all large ships), but the isolation penalty usually outweighs raw firepower for most combat situations.</p>

            A detrimental anomaly on a colonized planet will be costing you FIDSI from the moment of colonization until Stage 5 research is complete. On a medium galaxy at normal speed that gap can easily be 80–120+ turns. A "Strong Magnetic Field" applying −4 Industry / −2 Science per turn for 100 turns is a 600-point cumulative Industry loss and a 200-point Science loss before the fix even lands. Treat detrimental anomalies as permanent penalties when evaluating systems to colonize, not as temporary problems. The fix exists — it just costs far more than it looks.

          <p>Anomaly reduction via the <strong>terraforming behemoth</strong> (Behemoth Basic Climatology module, Science S3) offers a middle path: the behemoth can reduce anomalies on colonized planets, including detrimental ones, without requiring Stage 5. This is covered in detail in T7. If you have a severe detrimental anomaly on a high-value planet and behemoths are available, this may be your fastest practical remedy.</p>

This makes it the only behemoth action that can improve an already-inhabited world's anomaly situation without waiting for OCP Investigation (Stage 5 standard tech). For severe detrimental anomalies on high-value colonized planets, a behemoth with Climate Engineering is a meaningfully faster route than the tech tree alone.</p>

          <p>The single most strategically distinctive thing a terraforming behemoth can do is <strong>terraform planets in neutral systems before colonizing them</strong>. Standard in-system terraforming requires colonization first — you must own the planet and have a population on it before a build action can be queued. A behemoth bypasses this entirely.</p>

          <p>In practice: if you identify a neutral system with a Toxic planet sitting one step away from Steppes or Savannah (Primary Terraforming), you can send a behemoth there, complete the conversion, and then colonize a higher-tier planet rather than a Toxic one. The colonized planet's population capacity and FIDSI profile are immediately better. You've pre-paid an Industry cost (via the behemoth) to receive a better starting state for that colony.</p>

          <p>The <strong>reconstruction pipeline</strong> is the advanced version of this: an Obliterator-destroyed planet in any system can be restored by a behemoth with Advanced Climate Engineering. Restored planets always come back as Lava. Since Lava→Desert is a valid Primary Terraforming step, a behemoth can chain reconstruction directly into terraforming in the same orbit — restore the planet to Lava, then immediately begin converting it toward a more habitable type. This is the primary counter-play against Obliterator warfare in systems you want to settle.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <div class="callout-label">TIMING THE PRE-TERRAFORM</div>
            Pre-terraforming a neutral system is only strategically sound if no other major faction is likely to colonize it first. A behemoth parked at a neutral system is not fighting and not producing elsewhere. If a rival colonizes while your behemoth is mid-terraform, you've invested Industry into improving their planet. Scout the contested neighborhood before committing.

          <p>If the Pirates option is enabled at game setup, <strong>pirates spawn exclusively from minor faction systems</strong>. There is no other spawn source. This has a direct strategic implication: finding and controlling a minor faction's system controls the pirate spawning point for that galaxy node.</p>

          <p>Pirates can travel between galaxy nodes — a pirate spawned from a minor faction in a distant arm can eventually reach your systems. However, they originate from the minor faction's specific location, which means keeping a ship at that system gives you persistent interception capability.</p>

          <p>On <strong>Endless difficulty</strong>, pirate fleets field modernized ship designs — often better-equipped than early-game major faction ships. Treating them as a minor nuisance on higher difficulties is a mistake. A pirate fleet that catches your colony ship or lightly armed scout can end a colonization attempt outright.</p>

          <p>Because pirates respawn from minor faction systems on a predictable cycle, a fleet stationed at the spawning system fights them as they appear. This converts the pirate threat into a controlled hero and fleet XP source. The pattern is straightforward:</p>

          <ul class="step-list">
            <li><span class="step-n">STEP 1</span><span>Locate the minor faction system that is your region's pirate spawn point.</span></li>

            <li><span class="step-n">STEP 3</span><span>Each pirate spawn triggers a battle — your fleet fights and gains XP. Pirates sometimes retreat rather than fighting to the end.</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p>For the <strong>Hissho</strong>, killing pirates also generates <em>Kei</em> (their unique resource), making this strategy especially potent. In the early game when Kei generation is low, a pirate farm near a minor faction can sustain the Kei economy while the empire is still small.</p>

            Pirates will sometimes retreat from a losing battle rather than fighting to destruction. This means your fleet won't always finish a pirate engagement in one turn. The retreat behavior appears to be probabilistic — the exact programming logic isn't documented in available sources.

          <p>Each minor faction has a <strong>Diplomatic Relation bar</strong> that fills from 0 to 100 via Influence spending. The two active Influence actions are <strong>Praise</strong> (a direct relation point purchase, cost increases with each use) and <strong>Assist</strong> (triggers a quest — completing the quest grants relation points, often more efficiently than Praise).</p>

          <p>Even before assimilation, a minor faction with a filled or partially filled relation bar generates <strong>passive tribute</strong> each turn — Manpower, Dust, Science, and/or Food depending on the minor faction's type. In the early game when your FIDSI numbers are small, a single well-developed minor faction relationship can contribute more Science per turn than your entire civilization's output. This is not an exaggeration: some Horatio playthroughs show a minor faction relationship accounting for 30%+ of total science output by the mid-game.</p>

This costs 15 of a randomly selected luxury resource (usually purchasable from the Marketplace) and provides a significant science boost.

          <p>Once the relation bar reaches 100, the <strong>Assimilate</strong> button unlocks. Assimilation converts the minor faction's system into one of your own: the population stays, you gain full control of the system and can build there freely. The minor faction's population type brings its own FIDSI traits and political party affiliation into your empire — who you assimilate shapes your population composition over time.</p>

          <p>Not assimilating is also a valid choice. <strong>Maintaining a minor faction as a tribute source without absorbing them</strong> keeps your Overcolonization count lower (which matters for Approval), gives you continued passive FIDSI from the relationship, and avoids absorbing a population that might destabilize your political balance. The decision to assimilate should weigh the system's FIDSI value against the Approval cost of adding another colony.</p>

          <p>If you don't assimilate, the minor faction's population will still naturally <strong>migrate into your systems</strong> over time as you develop your empire and their pops find your systems more attractive. You gain the population benefits without the assimilation overhead.</p>

          <p>The implication is significant: <strong>a science victory demands broad tech tree investment, not deep specialization in the Science quadrant alone.</strong> You need Tier 5 Military technologies to unlock two of the four Endless techs. A player who fully neglects the Military tree cannot win by science. This is the built-in self-defense requirement — you must research enough military tech to unlock the prerequisites, which means you will also have access to meaningful military capability by the time you're in contention for a science win.</p>

            <div class="callout-label">ALLIANCE SCALING — A HARD TRAP</div>
            In an alliance, the number of Endless technologies required increases — but each player must research their own set independently. You cannot research additional Endless techs on behalf of an ally. Once you've researched your four, you win only if your allies have independently completed their portions too. Unlike Wonder victory, where one player can build all the Obelisks themselves, a science victory within an alliance requires synchronized progress across all members. Entering alliances late specifically to push a science win rarely works — your allies may not be close to their own Endless techs.

In practice you need <strong>at minimum 3 Stage 5 techs in every quadrant</strong> to satisfy all four unlock conditions simultaneously.</p>

Racing to build these before a scientifically competitive opponent is a meaningful priority.</p>

      "Research Autonomous Materials now — it handles the mixed anomaly on the third planet; accept the magnetic field as a long-term cost and colonize around it",
      "Research Baryonic Shielding first — Advanced Scanners will reveal better systems to compensate for the FIDSI loss",
      "Neither — detrimental anomaly removal is a Stage 5 technology (OCP Investigation), so accept the penalty; do not let it distort your research priorities toward a multi-stage detour"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explain: "OCP Investigation Unit is a Stage 5 technology under Ontological Rev-Eng, costing 5,256 base Science — it is not reachable until very late game. 'Pushing toward it fast' from Stage 2 is a multi-stage detour that will cost many more turns than the anomaly penalty is worth. Option D is correct: treat the detrimental anomaly as a permanent cost and do not distort early research priorities around it. Autonomous Materials (B) only addresses mixed anomalies, not purely detrimental ones — it would not affect the Strong Magnetic Field. Baryonic Shielding (C) is valuable for exploration but doesn't interact with anomalies. The right answer is to internalize the loss, colonize accordingly, and stay on your primary research path — with a note that a terraforming behemoth's anomaly reduction action (available from Science Stage 3) is the realistic mid-game fix if the penalty is severe enough to warrant it."

    scenario: "Turn 18. You have one minor faction at 60 relation — they provide +12 Science per turn as passive tribute. You have 400 Influence saved. Assimilating them would require reaching 100 relation (40 more points via Praise at ~30 Influence per increment, scaling up). Their system has two Arid planets with decent population slots and no anomalies. Assimilating would add 1 colony to your empire, currently at 3 colonized systems with Approval at 72%.",
    q: "Should you assimilate immediately, and what is the most important factor in that decision?",
    opts: [
      "Yes — the +12 Science/turn stops once you assimilate and direct ownership of their system is always superior",
      "No — the Approval cost of a 4th colony at 72% base Approval is the primary concern; the FIDSI value of their planets must be weighed against the multiplier loss",
      "Yes — 400 Influence is enough to max the relation bar immediately, so opportunity cost is low",
      "No — minor faction populations have lower base FIDSI than major faction pops and never justify the influence spend"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "The Approval multiplier is the core issue (covered in Vol.2 T1). Adding a 4th colony reduces Approval. If Approval drops below a threshold (e.g., from 72% into the 60s), the empire-wide FIDSI multiplier decreases, meaning all existing population becomes less productive. The +12 Science passive tribute continues as long as you don't assimilate — you don't lose it by waiting. Option A is incorrect: tribute income is not cancelled by high relations, only by assimilation or war. Option C ignores the Approval cost entirely. Option D is false — minor faction pops vary widely and some are excellent FIDSI contributors."

    scenario: "Turn 22. You're playing a science-focused empire. The behemoth unlock quest just completed galaxy-wide. You have 380 Industry and can build a science behemoth in 4 turns. Your home system produces 48 Science/turn and you have 2 other colonized systems. You have not yet researched the behemoth tech-cost-reduction module.",
    q: "What is the correct sequence of actions to maximize science behemoth value?",
    opts: [
      "Build the science behemoth immediately and park it at your home system for the passive +10 Science bonus while you research the tech-cost-reduction module in parallel",
      "Research the tech-cost-reduction module first, then build the behemoth — building before researching the module means the behemoth provides only the flat +10 bonus until research completes",
      "Build two science behemoths simultaneously before researching any module, as the stacked orbit bonuses (+20 Science) exceed the single-behemoth +10 plus the tech reduction on most turn horizons",
      "Wait until you have both the tech-cost-reduction module and the second behemoth tech unlocked before building any — the combined effect is strictly better than partial implementation"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explain: "Option A is correct because the +10 FIDSI system orbit bonus is active the moment the behemoth is in orbit — you don't need the tech-cost-reduction module researched to benefit from it. Starting the build immediately and researching the module in parallel means you lose no turns of the orbit bonus. Option B delays the orbit bonus with no benefit. Option C cannot be done simultaneously — behemoth count is limited by your researched technologies, and you cannot build a second science behemoth without the appropriate upgrade tech. Option D wastes multiple turns of +10 Science bonus while waiting for ideal conditions."

    scenario: "Turn 45, fast speed, medium galaxy. You are 6 turns from researching your 3rd Tier 5 Science technology and have 2 Tier 5 Empire techs already. You have no Tier 5 Military or Economy techs. A rival is at 1 Endless technology researched and is growing quickly. You have a small but functional defensive fleet.",
    q: "Which of the following diagnoses of your situation is most accurate?",
    opts: [
      "You are on track — once you get your 3rd Tier 5 Science tech, you unlock Power of the Endless immediately and are one step from winning",
      "You are critically behind — Power of the Endless requires Tier 5 in Science AND Empire (you have 2 Empire, need 3), and you have zero progress toward the Military prerequisites that block Might and Wealth of the Endless",
      "Your military neglect is your primary problem — build warships immediately and stop all science research to address the military deficit",
      "You should form an alliance with the leading rival to combine Endless tech counts and win cooperatively"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "Option B is the correct diagnosis. Power of the Endless needs 3 Tier 5 in Science AND 3 Tier 5 in Empire — you have only 2 Empire Tier 5 techs, so even the most accessible Endless tech is still blocked. More critically, Might of the Endless (Military + Empire) and Wealth of the Endless (Military + Economy) both require Tier 5 Military progress you haven't started. A science victory player at turn 45 with zero Tier 5 Military research has a structural gap, not just a speed problem. Option A misreads the prerequisite — Power of the Endless needs 3 Tier 5 in Empire, not 2. Option C overcorrects — stopping all science would destroy your primary advantage. Option D is counterproductive: alliances increase the number of Endless techs required, not decrease them."
